# Pocket CFO

Pocket CFO is an evidence-native finance discovery and decision system.

It is **not** a generic finance chatbot and it is **not** an autonomous accounting agent.
It turns messy finance questions and raw source bundles into typed finance missions, a persisted Finance Twin, a compiled CFO Wiki, and decision-ready evidence artifacts.

## Current repo state

This repository is past the pivot-foundation reset and the first narrow finance-twin slices.

The active guidance layer now describes **Pocket CFO**.
Some code, package names, database names, and legacy modules still say `pocket-cto`.
Treat those as implementation scaffolding, not as product direction.
The control-plane spine stays; the finance evidence substrate is what changes.

Read `docs/ACTIVE_DOCS.md` before trusting older plans or engineering-era docs.

Today the merged backbone is:

- F1 raw source registration and immutable file ingest
- F2A deterministic trial-balance CSV sync into the Finance Twin
- F2B deterministic chart-of-accounts CSV sync and account-catalog reads
- F2C deterministic general-ledger CSV sync and persisted journal-entry or journal-line state
- F2D additive company snapshot and lineage reads across the latest successful implemented finance slices
- F2E additive backend-first reconciliation-readiness reads, source-grounded slice-alignment truthfulness, and more specific general-ledger activity lineage drill behavior
- F2F additive reporting-window truth hardening, explicit general-ledger period-context reads, and period-scoped reconciliation semantics without fake variance
- F2G additive matched-period account-bridge-readiness reads plus chart-of-accounts-backed unmatched diagnostics without inventing a numeric bridge
- F2H additive balance-bridge-prerequisites reads for trial-balance-versus-general-ledger account scope, explicit account-level proof diagnostics, and diagnostic-versus-limitation hardening without fake bridge numbers or variance
- F2I additive source-backed general-ledger opening-balance and ending-balance proof support from explicit persisted fields only, plus snapshot diagnostic-versus-limitation polish
- F2J additive backend-first balance-proof lineage drill and read behavior on top of persisted proof rows and lineage
- F2K additive deterministic `bank_account_summary_csv` extraction plus backend-first bank-account inventory and cash-posture reads without fake FX conversion, transaction detail, or bank reconciliation
- F2L additive deterministic `receivables_aging_csv` extraction plus backend-first receivables-aging and collections-posture reads without fake invoice detail, expected cash timing, reserve logic, or DSO
- F2M additive deterministic `payables_aging_csv` extraction plus backend-first payables-aging and payables-posture reads without fake bill detail, expected payment timing, reserve logic, or DPO

The active next slice is F2N:

- additive deterministic `contract_metadata_csv` extraction from stored raw source bytes
- persisted contract and explicit obligation state plus backend-first contract inventory and obligation-calendar reads
- truthful contract-posture limits around dates, obligation semantics, currencies, weak source labels, and raw-source-backed provenance without clause parsing, legal interpretation, payment forecasting, or covenant logic

## Product boundary for v1

Pocket CFO v1 is intentionally narrow:

- single company
- single operator
- single trust boundary
- manual-export and file-first ingest
- finance evidence first; GitHub is only an optional connector
- PWA-first operator surface
- Codex App Server as the coding/runtime seam
- no autonomous bank writes, accounting writes, tax filings, or legal advice
- no multi-tenant SaaS boundary in v1

## What is already decided

1. **Mission, replay, and proof stay.**
   The orchestration spine from Pocket CTO is still the most valuable part of the repo.

2. **Raw finance sources become the product boundary.**
   The primary source of truth is no longer a repository or PR flow.
   It is source files, documents, policies, definitions, exports, and derived structured state.

3. **The engineering twin becomes a Finance Twin.**
   Keep the twin engine pattern, but replace the ontology and query semantics.

4. **A compiled CFO Wiki sits beside the twin.**
   The twin is the machine-queryable layer.
   The CFO Wiki is the operator-readable markdown layer built from raw sources plus twin facts.

5. **GitHub is demoted to connector status.**
   Keep the integration patterns, but do not let GitHub define the product.

6. **Internal package scope stays stable for now.**
   Keep `@pocket-cto/*` until the finance vertical is implemented cleanly enough to justify a later rename.

## Working architecture planes

1. **Source Registry** for uploads, snapshots, checksums, provenance, and raw artifacts.
2. **Finance Twin** for deterministic structured entities, edges, freshness, and lineage.
3. **CFO Wiki** for compiled markdown pages, indexes, backlinks, and durable analysis notes.
4. **Mission Engine** for analysis, reporting, monitoring, diligence, and close/control work.
5. **Evidence & Output Layer** for answers, memos, packets, and appendices.
6. **Operator Surface** for ingest, review, approval, export, and tracked questions.

## Immediate build order

1. Read `docs/ACTIVE_DOCS.md`.
2. Read `START_HERE.md`.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`.
4. Read `PLANS.md`.
5. Read `plans/ROADMAP.md`.
6. Read the current active `plans/FP-*.md` file for the next narrow slice instead of restarting from `FP-0001`.
7. The current active plan is `plans/FP-0022-contract-metadata-and-obligation-calendar.md`.
8. Keep progress updates inside the active Finance Plan while working.
9. Do not delete legacy engineering modules until the finance replacement path exists and a smoke proves it.

## Local development

The repo still boots with the existing monorepo structure and internal package names.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
pnpm install
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Use `docs/ops/local-dev.md` for the pivot-aware operating pattern.
The current packaged local proofs for the finance path are:

```bash
pnpm smoke:source-ingest:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-account-bridge:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-balance-bridge-prerequisites:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-source-backed-balance-proof:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-balance-proof-lineage:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-bank-account-summary:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-contract-metadata:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-payables-aging:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-receivables-aging:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-account-catalog:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-general-ledger:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-snapshot:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-reconciliation:local
pnpm smoke:finance-twin-period-context:local
```

The current backend-first finance-twin read surface is:

- company summary
- company snapshot
- account catalog
- general ledger
- lineage drill
- trial-balance-versus-general-ledger reconciliation readiness
- trial-balance-versus-general-ledger matched-period account-bridge readiness
- trial-balance-versus-general-ledger balance-bridge prerequisites
- truthful source-backed general-ledger balance proof inside balance-bridge prerequisites
- general-ledger balance-proof lineage drill
- bank-account inventory
- cash posture
- contract inventory
- obligation calendar
- payables-aging
- payables posture
- receivables-aging
- collections posture
- general-ledger account activity lineage

The current success condition is no longer an F0 guidance reset.
It is preserving the authoritative raw-source ingest spine while extending the deterministic Finance Twin additively and truthfully.

## North star

The hero behavior is:

> a founder or finance operator drops raw exports and documents into Pocket CFO, asks a typed finance question, and receives a cited answer, freshness posture, limitations, and a memo or packet that can survive outside chat.

Everything in this repository should push toward that behavior.
